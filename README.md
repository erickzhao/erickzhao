## Bonjour/Hi


ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Erick. I work on the Desktop team at [Slack](https://slack.com/). As part of my day job, I help maintain :electron: [Electron](https://github.com/electron/), mostly through maintaining its [docs and tooling](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-ecosystem) and growing its [community](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-outreach). Ask me about how you can contribute to Electron, or come chat with us on the :electron: [Discord](https://discord.gg/electronjs)!
