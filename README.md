## ðŸ‘‹ Bonjour/Hi/Hola/ä½ å¥½

I work on the Desktop team at [Slack](https://slack.com/). As part of my day job, I help maintain :electron: [Electron](https://github.com/electron/), a popular framework for building desktop applications with web technologies. Most of my maintainer effort is spent maintaining its [docs and tooling](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-ecosystem) and growing its [community](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-outreach).

Ask me about how you can contribute to Electron, or come chat with us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/electronjs) server!
