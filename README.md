## Bonjour/Hi 

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Erick. I work on the Desktop team at [Slack](https://slack.com/). As part of my day job, I help maintain :electron: [Electron](https://github.com/electron/), mostly through maintaining its [docs and tooling](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-ecosystem) and growing its [community](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-outreach). Currently, a good chunk of my open-source time is focused on managing our participation in [Google Season of Docs 2020](github.com/electron/season-of-docs-2020/). Ask me about how you can contribute to Electron!
